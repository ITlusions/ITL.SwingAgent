## Your First Signal

Let's generate your first swing trading signal:

```bash
python scripts/run_swing_agent.py --symbol AAPL --interval 30m --lookback-days 30
```

This command will:

1. **Download** 30 days of Apple (AAPL) stock data in 30-minute intervals
2. **Analyze** the current technical setup
3. **Search** for similar historical patterns
4. **Generate** a trading signal with entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels
5. **Store** the signal in your local database

## Understanding Your First Signal

Your signal output will look something like this:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "asof": "2024-01-15T15:30:00+00:00",
  "trend": {
    "label": "up",
    "price_above_ema": true,
    "rsi_14": 62.3
  },
  "entry": {
    "side": "long",
    "entry_price": 185.50,
    "stop_price": 182.20,
    "take_profit": 190.80,
    "r_multiple": 1.61
  },
  "confidence": 0.72,
  "expected_r": 0.95,
  "expected_winrate": 0.58,
  "action_plan": "Monitor for entry between $184.20-$186.10..."
}
```

### Key Information:

- **Entry Side**: "long" = buy, "short" = sell
- **Entry Price**: Recommended price to enter the trade
- **Stop Price**: Exit price if trade goes against you (limits loss)
- **Take Profit**: Target price to exit for profit
- **R Multiple**: Risk-to-reward ratio (1.61 means you risk $1 to potentially make $1.61)
- **Confidence**: System's confidence in the signal (0-1 scale)
- **Expected R**: Expected return based on historical similar setups
- **Expected Win Rate**: Percentage of similar historical setups that were profitable
- **Action Plan**: AI-generated explanation and trading plan

## Common Commands

### Generate Signals for Different Stocks

```bash
# Technology stock with tech sector comparison
python scripts/run_swing_agent.py --symbol NVDA --sector QQQ
